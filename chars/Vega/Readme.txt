=====<Move Details>=====

- Head Press can be used as a pursuit attack, to hit downed opponents

- Psycho Banish can destroy normal and special projectiles

- Strenth of Vega Warp determines how far from his starting position he will end up. However,
Reversal Warp's target location depends on the opponent's position;

- You may delay Vega Warp for a bit if you keep holding two punch/kick buttons, but if you
delay it for too long Vega will cancel the move;

- If you fire a Psycho Field and get hit before it explodes, Vega loses control over it and
the projectile dissipates without harming the opponent;

- Psycho Crusher and Heartbreak Despair destroy normal projectiles. Psycho Break Smasher
destroys normal and special projectiles. Final Psycho Crusher destroys any projectile
