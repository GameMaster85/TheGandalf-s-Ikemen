=====<Move Details>=====

 - Monstrosity is an overhead. (except when canceled into)
 - EX Deicide can hit falling opponents; futhermore, opponents hit by it will be drawn in towards Vice and will be
   stunned for a few moments
 - EX Mayhem can be juggled afterwards with any non-super attack.
 - Gorefest, EX Deicide Slayer, Blackend, Nailbomb, Negative Gain, Withering Surface, and Overkill are unblockable
   throws.
 - Overkill can also be performed with a 360 degree motion
 - The button used to activate Withering Surface determines jump height and distance covered;
 - Cannibal Corpse reverses all physical attacks while Vice walks forward.



=====<Gameplay Notes>=====

COMBO SYSTEM:
 - Some Normal attacks can be canceled into Command, Special and Super moves
 - Some Special moves can be canceled into Super moves
 - Canceling a Special, Super move or Custom Combo into a Super move resets the juggle points
   but also reduces its damage


CUSTOM COMBO:
 - Removes cancellable attack restrictions and gives you a lot of freedom to combo them
 - Juggle limit is lifted
 - You can only use EX Special or Super moves from the point the character starts flashing faster
   and brighter, and doing so ends Custom Combo
 - Gives you a short invulnerability window at the start
