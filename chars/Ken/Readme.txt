=====<Move Details>=====

 - Both Inazuma Kakato Wari (all versions) and Ryusenkyaku are overheads.
 - Fujin Sen Geri can be juggled afterwards with any attack if both hits connect.
 - During Shinryuken, you can mash buttons increase the number of hits.
 - Kuzuryureppa can be juggled afterwards with any attack if the final hits connect.
 - Souryuken uses 3 powerbars, and can only be used in simul mode with Ryu by P.o.t.S. as your
   teammate; Ken and Ryu must be on opposite sides of the opponent for the attack to initiate.
   Additionally, Ryu must be in either Normal mode or Master mode; likewise, Ken must be in either
   Normal mode or Master mode.
 - Jouen Shinryuken can also be performed with this alternate command: B, DB, D, DF, F, 2p

=====<Gameplay Notes>=====

COMBO SYSTEM:
 - Some Normal attacks can be canceled into Special and Super moves
 - Some Special moves can be canceled into Super moves
 - Some Lv1 Super moves can be canceled into MAX Super moves
 - Cancelling a Special, Super move or Custom Combo into a Super move resets the juggle points
   but also reduces its damage


CUSTOM COMBO:
 - Removes cancellable attack restrictions and gives you a lot of freedom to combo them
 - Juggle limit is lifted
 - You can only use EX Special or Super moves from the point the character starts flashing faster
   and brighter, and doing so ends Custom Combo
 - Gives you a short invulnerability window at the start
