=====<Other Info>=====

<<<<<Selecting the win pose>>>>>
(taken from Kao Megura's SFZ3 FAQ, found at www.GameFAQs.com)

X or A -> Guy crosses his arms
Y or B -> Guy turns away, holds an arm up, then lets it fall.
He says "Waruku omou na." (Don't think badly of me)
Z or C -> Guy holds his other arm by the wrist, with his fingers pointed up.
He says "Korezo, Bushin-ryuu!"  (This is Bushin style!)
Start -> (only when the fight is over) Guy walks away... Final Fight style =D
