 - Chuudan Atemi Nage reverses mid-level normal attacks
 - Gedan Atemi Nage reverses low normal attacks
 - Joudan Atemi Nage reverses jumping attacks, specials and supers
 - All Atemi Nage moves share the same EX version, which reverses low and mid-level normal
   attacks

 - Rashoumon is unblockable
 - Rashoumon is not comboable unless you Super Cancel into it
 - MAX Kyokuu Reppu Zan is only fully performed if Geese connects with the last punch

=====<Gameplay Notes>=====

COMBO SYSTEM:
 - Some Normal attacks can be canceled into Command, Special and Super moves
 - Some Special moves can be canceled into Super moves
 - Some Lv1 Super moves can be canceled into MAX Super moves
 - Cancelling a Special, Super move or Custom Combo into a Super move resets the juggle points
   but also reduces its damage


CUSTOM COMBO:
 - Removes cancellable attack restrictions and gives you a lot of freedom to combo them
 - Juggle limit is lifted
 - You can only use EX Special or Super moves from the point the character starts flashing
   faster and brighter, and doing so ends Custom Combo
 - Gives you a short invulnerability window at the start



=====<Version History>=====

 - For Mugen 1.0 now
 - Can select win poses by holding buttons
 - Raging Dead End is faster and more damaging
 - Kyokuu Reppu Zan is invulnerable until the first hitting frame (second for MAX version)

<27.03.09>
 - Some fixes

<14.12.08>

 - Fixed the forward dash timing and distance
