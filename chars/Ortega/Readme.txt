- Customized version of Ortega character from Slammasters II
- Strong enough for Mugen 1.0, but made for Winmugen

=======================| Info |=======================

- This is my customized version of Ortega from the Slammasters II video game.
- HE IS NOT MEANT TO BE ACCURATE TO THE SOURCE GAME!!! I wanted him to play more like he was created for a crossover-type Capcom game.
- SPRITES ARE OPEN SOURCE!!! May not be properly aligned, but i did my best.....
-Was going to clean the sprites, but decided these were good enough

-Ortega can chain moves into each other. Here are his basic combo rules:

      1.  You can combo from weaker basic attacks into stronger ones

      2.  You can combo into special attacks from most basic attacks

      3.  You can combo into hyper attacks from all basic and special attacks

      4.  You can combo from hyper attacks into other hyper attacks,
               as long as you do not do the same hyper twice in a row
