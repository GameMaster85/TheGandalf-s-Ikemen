=====<Move Details>=====

 - The neutral jumping hard punch in my version of Honda steers him automatically forward (yes
 I realize this function is obsolete with rolling and parry)
 - Last button used when performing Hyakuretsu Harite determines its strength. If it is two
 punch buttons the EX version is triggered
 - Keep tapping punch buttons to extend Hyakuretsu Harite indefinitely
 - Ooichou Nage and Orochi Kudaki are unblockable throws
 - The first headbutt of Oni Musou can absorb one projectile hit, while its MAX version can
 usually fly through any ammount of hits
 - Fuji Oroshi resets juggle points
 - Mash buttons during MAX Fuji Oroshi to increase the number of hits



=====<Gameplay Notes>=====

COMBO SYSTEM:
 - Some Normal attacks can be canceled into Special and Super moves
 - Some Special moves can be canceled into Super moves
 - Some Lv1 Super moves can be canceled into MAX Super moves
 - Cancelling a Special, Super move or Custom Combo into a Super move resets the juggle points
 but also reduces its damage


CUSTOM COMBO:
 - Removes cancellable attack restrictions and gives you a lot of freedom to combo them
 - Juggle limit is lifted
 - You can only use EX Special or Super moves from the point the character starts flashing
 faster and brighter, and doing so ends Custom Combo
 - Gives you a short invulnerability window at the start

 
NOTE ON CUSTOM COMBO DAMAGE:
 - Due to the high damaging nature of all of Honda's normal attacks and the reduced cost of
 Custom Combo (1 level compared to 3), I made its damage be especially dampened



=====<Miscellaneous Notes>=====

 - Holding down a button as Honda wins a round allows you to select his win pose
 - Because I didn't want to override Mugen's entire handling of control just for AI purposes,
 the AI doesn't need to charge directions



=====<Version History>=====

<12.01.2010>
 - For Mugen 1.0 now

<27.03.09>
 - Some minor fixes
 - Added palettes 7 to 12

<23.03.09>
 - First release



=====<What's Missing>=====

 - Testing and tweaking
 - I'm not very pleased with how both of his MAX supers involve the slaps.  Was thinking about
 making MAX Fuji Oroshi different and letting its slaps part be another Lv3 Super, but couldn't
 think of something that'd a) be useful, b) not be redundant in function, and c) not change his
 play style. Thought of making it a counter pose, but that kinda violates c), is lazy, and
 makes Geese and company less special.
