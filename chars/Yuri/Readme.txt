- If you hit an opponent while he's attacking, you'll do 20% extra damage;

- During Excel Combo, you can cancel any connecting Normal or Special into any attack or
Forward Roll, but while in the air you can't cancel Specials into Normals;

- Just as Excel Combo is about to end, when Yuri is flashing faster, you can perform an EX
Special or a Lv1 Super;

- A Super performed after another will not cause guard damage on the opponent;



=====<Miscellaneous>=====

- Holding a button as Yuri wins a round allows you to select her win pose, as follows:

X or Y -> Yuri airs her shirt, then notices someone watching ang gives a thumbs up, while
saying "Yoyuucchi!" ("Piece of cake!")
A or B -> Yuri gives a thumbs up while saying "Yoyuusu! Natsuke!" ("Piece of cake! I win!")
C -> Yuri goes back to meditating. Makoto's win pose
Z -> Yuri tightens her belt, then does a victory pose while saying "Yari!" ("Did it!")

Win by Perfect -> Yuri starts adjusting her belt but accidentally loosens it exposing her
undershirt, then covers up while screaming "Mou saitei!" ("Not again!")
