=====<Move Details>=====

 - During Knees of Hades, you and your opponent can mash buttons to respectively increase or
   decrease the number of hits;
 - If the first two EX Hurricane Upper projectiles hit, the last one will knock down.
 - EX Slash Kick can be juggled afterwards with any attack if both hits connect.
 - Golden Heel can hit twice against airborne opponents.
 - EX Golden Heel is an overhead.
 - The last button used when performing TNT Punch determines its strength. If it is two
   punch buttons the EX version is triggered
 - Keep tapping punch buttons to extend TNT Punch indefinitely
 - Dynamite Fist or Dynamite Upper can be performed at any time during any TNT Punch move (except EX TNT
   Punch.)
 - The kick used to activate Golden Heel Kick determines its velocity.


=====<Gameplay Notes>=====

COMBO SYSTEM:
 - Some Normal attacks can be canceled into Special and Super moves
 - Some Special moves can be canceled into Super moves
 - Some Lv1 Super moves can be canceled into MAX Super moves
 - Cancelling a Special, Super move or Custom Combo into a Super move resets the juggle points
   but also reduces its damage


CUSTOM COMBO:
 - Removes cancellable attack restrictions and gives you a lot of freedom to combo them
 - Juggle limit is lifted
 - You can only use EX Special or Super moves from the point the character starts flashing
   faster and brighter, and doing so ends Custom Combo
 - Gives you a short invulnerability window at the start
