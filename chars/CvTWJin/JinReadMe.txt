***MUGEN 1.0 ONLY***

1.0 Update Change Log

-Added EX Moves (Demon's Paw, Savage Sword, Lift Kick, EGWH)
-Fixed infinites (hopefully)
-Fixed various juggle issues
-Added KoF-style Dodge, along with the mid-dodge attacks
-Tweaked various vels and hittimes and what not
-Added AI, using AI Level, for the first time by me
-Changed Tidal Wave command in the .cmd so it's easier to do

-This character is Jin Kazama from Tekken. His gameplay style is that of my upcoming full-game Capcom vs The World. Please remember that this is not an emulation of any particular style, but an entirely new one.

Controls (Important):

A = LK
B = HK
C = G (Grab)
X = LP
Y = HP
Z = SP (Special) - All Super commands are done with this button.

-The combo system is very loose and cancel heavy. Here are a few examples of Jin's combos:

1. LP > HP > Corpse Thrust > Demon's Paw > Evil Intent
2. LK > HK > Crouch HP > Air LP > Air HK > Air HP
3. LK > HK > LLRK > Spinning FLare Kick
4. LP > LP > HP > Corpse Thrust > Electric Wind God Hook > Avenger

You get the point. Just experiment to find new chains and combos.
