===============<Move Details>===============

- Kyuukyoku Tenchi Gadou Zuki is unblockable and can block one attack

- When (Rolling Attack) connects, Dan will bounce back if you hold that direction, and forward
otherwise. You can also press Start to taunt afterwards

- EX Uppercut is invincible at its start, so it works great as a "taunting counter" (sugoi!)

- Chouhatsu Densetsu completely fills Dan's powerbar if successful

- Lv2 Shinkuu Gadou Ken resets juggle points if it hits

- Otoko Michi is unblockable and invulnerable while he's dashing

- After Otoko Michi you'll lose your whole life bar, but it won't kill you;

- You can't attack during Chouhatsu Shinwa, instead, every button makes Dan taunt;

- During Chouhatsu Shinwa you can perform a free Chouhatsu Densetsu, at any time.



===============<Other Info>===============

<<<<<Selecting the win pose>>>>>
(Speech translations by Kibagami)

X -> Dan flexes his arm and says  "Yoshaa!" ("All right!"), or "Rakushou!" ("An easy win!")
Y -> Dan frees his arm from his gi, flexes it and says "Namen ja nee zo!" ("Don't understimate
me!), or "Kore ga Saikyou-Ryuu da!" ("This is the Saikyou style!")
Z -> Dan starts crying and says "Yatta ze...Oyaji!" ("I did it, father!")
A -> Dan gives a thumbs up and says "Kimatta ze!" ("It's over!")
B -> Dan gives a thumbs up and says "Yoyuushi!" ("Piece of cake!")
C -> Dan gives a thumbs up and says "Chou Yoyuushi!" ("Super Piece of cake!")

VS Sagat -> Dan does the Z win pose

<<<<<Extra win poses>>>>>

Win by Otoko Michi -> See for yourself =P

<<<<<Extra lose poses>>>>>

Lose against my Morrigan, by letting her perform Eternal Slumber.
