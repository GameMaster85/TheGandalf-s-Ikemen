=======================| Combo Notes |=======================

-Asura can chain moves into each other. Here are his basic combo rules:

      1.  You can combo from weaker basic attacks into stronger ones

      2.  You can combo into special attacks from most basic attacks

      3.  You can combo into hyper attacks from all basic and special attacks

      4.  You can combo from hyper attacks into other hyper attacks,
               as long as you do not do the same hyper twice in a row

=======================| Guard Breaker |======================

-Can absord 1 normal or special attack/projectile (takes away 500 power)
-Vunerable to all throws and super attacks/projectiles
-If hit while charging, you'll take 1.5 times the damage of the opponent's attack
-If charging after absorded hit with 0 power, health will decrease instead
