=====<Move Details>=====

 - Geshiki: Goufu You and Arashin are overheads (except when canceled into). 127 Shiki: Yanosabi, EX
   R.E.D. KicK, EX 75 Shiki Kai, and Geshiki: Naraku Otoshi are also overheads.

 - EX 101 Shiki: Oboro Guruma can hit opponents that have been juggled once.
 - Ura 108 Shiki: Orochinagi can avoid either low or high attacks while the move is being delayed,

 - The pillar of fire that appears during Saishu Kessen Ougi "Mushiki" and Saishu Kessen Ougi "Reishiki" can

=====<Gameplay Notes>=====

COMBO SYSTEM:
 - Some Normal attacks can be canceled into Command, Special and Super moves
 - Some Special moves can be canceled into Super moves
 - Some Lv1 Super moves can be canceled into MAX Super moves
 - Cancelling a Special, Super move or Custom Combo into a Super move resets the juggle points
   but also reduces its damage


CUSTOM COMBO:
 - Removes cancellable attack restrictions and gives you a lot of freedom to combo them
 - Juggle limit is lifted
 - You can only use EX Special or Super moves from the point the character starts flashing faster
   and brighter, and doing so ends Custom Combo
 - Gives you a short invulnerability window at the start
