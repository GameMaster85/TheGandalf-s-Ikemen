 I noticed some bugs while in the process of editing but somehow can't fix it(cuz i have no idea how)
  -Custom combo can sometimes malfunction if constantly used(though, i don't know how or when)
  -At some time, during crossing hits with each other, a hit spark is shown but Ryu is not affected by the hit and resumes his move and most likely countering the opponent(mostly occurs during shoryukens and crouching attacks)
