=====<Move Details>=====

 - Hyochuwari is an overhead. (except when canceled into)

 - Zanretsuken has autoguard.
 - Kyokugenryu Renbuken can be juggled afterwards with any attack; however, this can only be done once per combo.
 - EX Kyokugenryu Renbuken is an unblockable throw.
 - The button used to activate Withering Surface determines jump height and distance covered;
 - Tenchi Haohken instantly dizzies the opponent on hit.



=====<Gameplay Notes>=====

COMBO SYSTEM:
 - Some Normal attacks can be canceled into Command, Special and Super moves
 - Some Special moves can be canceled into Super moves
 - Canceling a Special, Super move or Custom Combo into a Super move resets the juggle points
   but also reduces its damage


CUSTOM COMBO:
 - Removes cancellable attack restrictions and gives you a lot of freedom to combo them
 - Juggle limit is lifted
 - You can only use EX Special or Super moves from the point the character starts flashing faster
   and brighter, and doing so ends Custom Combo
 - Gives you a short invulnerability window at the start
