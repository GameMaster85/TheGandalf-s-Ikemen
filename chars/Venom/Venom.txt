Venom v1.0 - Happy Halloween!
===========================================================
Vs Series character number 2!

=========================|Story|===========================
From a Venom FAQ:

Eddie Brock was a reporter who did a series of interviews with the vigilante
known as the Sin Eater, during which he, under pressure from the authorities,
revealed the name of the Sin-Eater himself. Unfortunately, Eddie didn't check
his sources carefully enough to find out his pal was a wacko who thought he
was the Sin-Eater, not the wacko who *was* the Sin-Eater. This mistake got him
fired for sloppy journalism. Since Spider-Man was the one who uncovered the
identity of the real Sin-Eater, Brock blamed the web-slinger for his
journalistic disgrace. Forced to write for sleaze magazines because no
respectable publication would touch him, Eddie soon found himself in church
contemplating suicide when the symbiont, weakened from a recent battle with
Spider-Man (The conclusion of the 'Black Spider-Man' series...) and attracted
by the force of Brock's despair, found him. When they bonded, the symbiont
became overwhelmed by Eddie's dislike for its former host, and taught Eddie
all of Peter Parker's secrets. The bonding didn't seem to improve the
emotional stability of either the symbiont or Eddie...

With their new form, Brock and the symbiont righteously deny the further
existence of "Eddie Brock" and constantly proclaim "We are Venom!". As Venom,
Eddie can do just about anything Spider-Man can beside posses extreme agility.
However, Venom has tricks up their sleeve that even Spidey can't match up
with. First of all, his symbiont is ultra protective. It acts as a sort of
armor, making potentially fatal blows "not-n butta thang" for Eddie. Second,
because the symbiont is sentient, it will assist Eddie in areas that he
forgets to attend to when in a dangerous situation. For example, if Eddie gets
floored or falls from a ledge, it would break his fall for him. Thirdly, the
symbiont can form harmful objects and extend them from Venom's body. In
addition to this, they can move undetected through shadows and thusly surprise
his enemies. Last but not least, the symbiont multiplies Eddies strength. All
of these powers combined make Venom a very tough cookie to slay.

Eddie shows that he aims for justice just like other super heroes: He 
occasionally performs a deed or two for innocent. However, when performing
these deeds, the symbiont gets the best of Brock. Venom usually kills every
wrongdoer they run into. The symbiont in and of itself is emotionally
disturbed in some way. Ever since Spider-Man decided to ditch it, it has been
evident that it would transfer these perturbed feelings into its host, making
it evil and just plain cranky. To make matters worse, the longer the symbiont
stays with a host, the harder it is to separate the two. This means that Brock
could soon be Venom indefinitely. If and when the symbiont takes full control
of his consciousness, all those ideas for the greater good will be expelled
from Venom's objectives and he will revert into a plain ol' baddie.

During the years following his bond with the symbiont, Brock would either hunt
Spider-Man down like a dog or get his attention by committing crimes: using
every which way to try to extract that revenge he so indignantly desired.
However, since Venom proved unsuccessful in all of their attempts, their
payback remains unpaid to this day.


About this character
--------------------------------------------
I always liked Venom in the comics, the cartoon, and in MvC. His style is very unorthodox and unpredictable at times, which makes him very dangerous in the right hands.
To install the character (about everyone knows how to do this, this is just 
for newbies) extract the files into the directory "chars\venom\" and open
select.cfg and add the line:"venom, stages/_______.def"

Gameplay Overview
--------------------------------------------
He plays like a Mix of her MvC and MvC2 incarnations. You can choose your combo style by editing the .def file. MvC style chains any punch to any kick. MvC2 style chains from weak to medium, or weak to strong. Normal(default) uses MvC2 style, but also lets you switch to EX mode (Also known as Red Venom/Carnage mode) with 1 level. A seperate .def file is also available for those who want EX Venom as a seperate character entry. "venom/EX.def, stages/_______.def"

Differences between modes:
EX Venom is much faster and can jump higher and farther.

EX Venom's normals and specials change

EX Venom's combo system changes. WP,WK,MP,MK,SP,SK or W-M-S

However, EX Venom takes almost twice the damage. So try not to get hit.
