=====<Move Details>=====

 - You can adjust Rolento's forward movement after jumping off the wall during Mekong Delta Escape by holding back or 
   forward
 - EX Patriot Circle can be juggled afterwards with any attack; however, this can only be done once per combo.
 - EX Mekong Delta Attack has one hit of autoguard throughout its active frames
 - EX Mekong Delta Escape is fully invincible until Rolento hits the grabs onto the wall
 - Patriot Sweeper can also be performed with this alternate command: B, DB, D, DF, F, 2p



=====<Gameplay Notes>=====

COMBO SYSTEM:
 - Some Normal attacks can be canceled into Special and Super moves
 - Some Special moves can be canceled into Super moves
 - Some Lv1 Super moves can be canceled into MAX Super moves
 - Cancelling a Special, Super move or Custom Combo into a Super move resets the juggle points
   but also reduces its damage

CUSTOM COMBO:
 - Removes cancellable attack restrictions and gives you a lot of freedom to combo them
 - Juggle limit is lifted
 - You can only use EX Special or Super moves from the point the character starts flashing faster
   and brighter, and doing so ends Custom Combo
 - Gives you a short invulnerability window at the start



=====<Miscellaneous>=====

- To change his size to TV aspect ratio (a.k.a. CvS scale), open the .def file and replace
  "ConstantsSFZ.cns" with "ConstantsCvS.cns".
