- Customized version of Tiger character from Martial Masters
- Strong enough for Mugen 1.0, but made for Winmugen

=======================| Info |=======================

- This is my customized version of Tiger from the Martial Masters video game.
- HE IS NOT MEANT TO BE ACCURATE TO THE SOURCE GAME!!! I wanted him to play more like he was created for a Capcom game.
- I didn't really like his shadow moves in the game, so I created them into special/super moves.
- SPRITES ARE OPEN SOURCE!!! May not be properly aligned, but i did my best.....

      3.  You can combo into hyper attacks from all basic and special attacks

               as long as you do not do the same hyper twice in a row
