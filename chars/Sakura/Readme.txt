=====<Move Details>=====

- Sakura Jime acts differently when used on small chars

- During Sakura Jime a power struggle occurs, and both you and your opponent can mash buttons
to increase/decrease the number of hits;

- Flower Kick is an overhead

- Tapping punch while Sakura is charging a Hadouken will make it larger and more powerful

- Whether Sakura trips or not while attempting to perform Shunpuu Renkyaku after a Kuuchuu
Shunpuu Kyaku depends on your timing . If you input the command for Shunpuu Renkyaku before
Sakura stops spinning, it will be successful;

- Sakura Otoshi can hit projectiles to make Sakura jump over them;

- Hold F or B with the proper timing to extend Sakura Dance



=====<Other Info>=====

- Her stage is available at my Stages section.


<Selecting the win pose>
(Speech translations by Kao Megura)

X -> Sakura raises her arm, laughing, while the wind ruffles her clothes. Ryu's win pose.
Y -> Sakura starts dancing.
Z -> Sakura does a couple of kicks and one of her shoes flies off. She then yells and the shoe
hits her in the head.
A -> Sakura does a couple of kicks and yells.
B -> Sakura wipes the sweat from her face, waves her hand and says "Kono toko da ne!" ("That's
how it's done!").
C -> Sakura crosses her arms and looks away while the wind ruffles her clothes. Ryu's win pose.

Start -> Kei comes running and one of two things happens:
- She trips and falls on her face
- She starts dancing along with Sakura


<Extra win poses>

Win by Shun Goku Satsu -> Sakura has her back turned to the screen and says "Kono toko da ne!".
Kei looks at Sakura's opponent and runs away scared.

Win by Perfect -> Sakura yawns

<v.1.3>
- Haru Ichiban no longer does decent damage on downed opponents, but now does a cool juggle

- Sakura Otoshi now bounces up even if guarded
- Flower Kick now has some invulnerability to low attacks
- Nicer impact on Nekketsu Hadouken
- Nekketsu Hadouken no longer goes over (really) small chars
- Dark Sakura's Hadouken comes out faster

- Added win pose by Perfect
- Super moves now consume power on the very first instant, not during the superpause



=====<What's Missing>=====

- Remake the char
- Maybe a Lv2 or Lv3 diagonal Hadou Ken inspired by the MvSF version. The player would need to
press punch to fire additional projectiles, kind of like Charlie's Sonic Break
- Replace some palettes
